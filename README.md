# My 100 days of code Journal

I am a beginner in Data Structures and Algorithms with LeetCode. I started my journey on 3rd August 2024. This is my personal journal where I will keep track of my progress, difficulties I faced and solutions I figured out. I will also share my solutions with you.

In this journal, I will be sharing the solutions for each problem I solve. I will also keep track of the days I complete and the problems I solve on each day.

I will also share my thought process on each problem, how I approach it, and sometimes the resources I used to solve it.

I am excited to see how far I can go in this journey.

Let's begin!
